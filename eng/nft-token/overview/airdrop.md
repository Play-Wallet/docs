# üéÅ Airdrop

After the mainnet launch, 500 tokens will be distributed randomly to members who completed all tasks on [**Zealy**](https://zealy.io/c/playwallet/invite/GsvZSOQU1MOGOa5EBhG\_h) **(previous Crew3)** platform according to Play Wallet community. The distribution of rarity will follow the existing model. Here's the breakdown of how many tokens of each rarity will be given away in the airdrop:

* **Common (200 tokens):** A total of 200 Common NFT tokens will be airdropped. This represents 40% of the 500 tokens being distributed.
* **Uncommon (150 tokens):** A total of 150 Uncommon NFT tokens will be airdropped. This represents 30% of the 500 tokens being distributed.
* **Rare (100 tokens):** A total of 100 Rare NFT tokens will be airdropped. This represents 20% of the 500 tokens being distributed.
* **Legendary (50 tokens):** A total of 50 Legendary NFT tokens will be airdropped. This represents 10% of the 500 tokens being distributed.

Remember, these tokens will be given away to active participants of the project's beta testing in the testnet, offering them an opportunity to benefit from the platform's revenue distribution based on the rarity of their NFTs.
