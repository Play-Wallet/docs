# Payout scenarios

### **All Participants Win, No Losing P**rediction**s**

In the event that all participants prediction on the winning outcome and there are no losing predictions to fund the payouts, the Play Wallet platform will distribute 100 PLAYW tokens among the winning participants. The distribution will be done using the pari-mutuel system, where the PLAYW tokens are proportionally allocated based on the amount of each participant's prediction.

This approach ensures that even in situations where there are no losing predictions to fund the payouts, the winning participants still receive a reward for their successful predictions, albeit in the form of PLAYW tokens instead of the original currency they used for prediction.

### **All Participants Lose, No Winning P**rediction**s**

In cases where all participants prediction on the losing outcome and there are no winning predictions to receive the payouts, the Play Wallet platform will distribute the funds as follows:

1. **Trading Contract**: 50% of the total amount prediction will be sent to the trading contract. This mechanism ensures that the platform maintains liquidity and can continue to facilitate trading activities.
2. **PLAYW Token Stakers**: The remaining 50% of the total amount prediction will be distributed among all users who are staking the PLAYW token. This distribution serves as an incentive for users to stake their PLAYW tokens and support the platform's ecosystem.

By addressing these unique payout scenarios, the Play Wallet platform ensures a fair and transparent prediction environment for its users. In addition, the use of the PLAYW token in these situations highlights the token's utility and importance within the platform's ecosystem.
