NFT holders play a pivotal role in Play Wallet. As primary investors, they gain access to the platform's exclusive features beyond the public play modes and staking. NFT holders have the unique opportunity to participate in shaping the project's development direction, influencing added functionality, and making other crucial decisions that impact the platform's growth and success. This involvement ensures that the project evolves in a way that aligns with the interests and preferences of its valued stakeholders.

The trading contract plays a crucial role in amplifying the funds invested in the project. Governed by the DAO contract, it manages the trading strategy, with funds being supplied by both the NFT and Play modes contracts. All profits generated are then directed to the Revenue distribution contract, which ensures the fair allocation of proceeds among NFT holders. This integrated approach effectively links various components of the platform to deliver a seamless and efficient profit-generating experience for NFT holders.

### Revenue distribution

The profit distribution process is designed for maximum transparency. Profits are allocated based on the quantity and rarity of the NFTs you hold, ensuring a fair and equitable system that rewards active and invested participants in the platform.
