The Walking Mode is an exclusive feature available only to NFT holders on the Play Wallet platform. This innovative mode provides users with the opportunity to earn PLAYW tokens by staking (or "freezing") their NFT tokens for static period of time.

By participating in the Walking Mode, NFT holders can unlock additional value from their digital assets and receive passive income in the form of PLAYW tokens. This unique mode not only incentivizes users to hold and collect NFTs on the platform but also enhances the overall utility and value proposition of the NFT ecosystem within Play Wallet.

To participate in the Walking Mode, users simply need to stake their NFT tokens for a predetermined duration. The longer the staking period, the more PLAYW tokens they can potentially earn. This creates a flexible and rewarding system that caters to various user preferences and investment strategies.

The Walking Mode serves as an innovative approach to digital asset monetization, allowing NFT holders to maximize their earnings potential while also engaging with the Play Wallet platform. This feature solidifies Play Wallet's commitment to providing diverse and valuable opportunities for its user base, ensuring the platform remains an attractive destination for NFT enthusiasts and gamers alike.
