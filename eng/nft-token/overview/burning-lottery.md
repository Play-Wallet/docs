# ðŸ”¥ Burning Lottery

The Burning Lottery is a unique event designed to reduce the number of NFT tokens participating in the project while ensuring that affected token holders are fairly compensated. In 2024, before expanding to other networks, a lottery will be held to select a 20% of the NFT tokens to be removed from the project.

Token holders whose NFTs are chosen in the lottery will receive compensation in the form of the internal token, $PLAYW, equivalent to the price they originally paid for their NFT token. This ensures that even though their NFTs are removed from the project, they will still be able to benefit from their initial investment.

By reducing the number of NFT tokens through the Burning Lottery, the project aims to maintain a healthy balance between scarcity and accessibility, ensuring that the remaining NFT holders can enjoy even greater rewards and benefits.

In addition to the compensation provided through the Burning Lottery, those who are unlucky in the lottery will still have opportunities to participate in the project on other networks. They can either join the project on different L2 networks, where Play Wallet will expand its presence, or they can purchase NFT tokens from remaining participants who are willing to sell theirs, or participate in the [Auction](auction.md).

This ensures that even if a participant's NFT token is removed during the Burning Lottery, they still have the chance to stay involved with the project and benefit from its growth and development across multiple networks. The flexibility provided by these options aims to maintain a strong and engaged community of users and investors, contributing to the long-term success of the Play Wallet platform.
