# Fees

We have two types of fees in our ecosystem:

1. **Buy/Sell $PLAYW fees:** These fees are collected when a user or NFT holder adds token liquidity to the $PLAYW liquidity pool. A rate of 1% is charged for each transaction, contributing to the project's revenue.
2. **Network Expansion Fees:** These fees account for 10% of the total project revenue and are generated when the project is launched on other networks. This helps to support the project's expansion and ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem across multiple platforms.
3. **Play Modes Fees:** These fees are collected when a user participate in play modes. A rate of 1% is charged for each participation, contributing to the project's revenue.
