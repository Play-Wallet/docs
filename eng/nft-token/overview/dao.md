# üçÄ DAO

The Play Wallet project empowers its NFT holders by including them in the decision-making process through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). NFT holders become part of the DAO and can influence the development of the project and make important management decisions. As part of the DAO, NFT holders can have an impact on various aspects of the project:

1. **Adding New Features:** NFT holders can propose and vote on new features or improvements to the platform. This ensures that the platform evolves according to the community's needs and interests.
2. **Selecting Investment Tools for the Trading Contract:** NFT holders can vote on which investment tools should be used for the Trading Contract. This allows the community to steer the project's financial strategy and help maximize returns.
3. **Reviewing Fee Structures Every Six Months:** NFT holders have the ability to review and potentially adjust the platform's fee structure every six months. This ensures that the fees remain fair and competitive.
4. **Choosing New Themes for Event Battle:** NFT holders can propose and vote on new themes for the Event Battle mode. This allows the community to keep the game engaging and exciting by introducing fresh content.
5. **Selecting Networks for Future Launches:** NFT holders can vote on which networks the project should expand to next. This helps to ensure that the project remains accessible to a wide range of users and leverages the best opportunities in the blockchain ecosystem.

By involving NFT holders in the decision-making process through the DAO, Play Wallet ensures that its community remains engaged and actively contributes to the project's development and success.\
