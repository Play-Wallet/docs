# ðŸª™ NFT Holder

NFT holders in the Play Wallet ecosystem receive various rewards based on the rarity of their NFTs. These rewards are generated from two primary sources:

1. **Profit of Trading Contract (90%):** NFT holders receive 90% of the profits generated by the trading contract.
2. **Fees from Opening on Next Networks (100%):** NFT holders receive 100% of the fees collected from opening the platform on additional networks.

The NFTs are categorized into four different rarities, each with a specific distribution percentage:

* Common (4,000 NFTs): 20% of rewards
* Uncommon (3,000 NFTs): 25% of rewards
* Rare (2,000 NFTs): 25% of rewards
* Legendary (1,000 NFTs): 30% of rewards

### Reward Distribution Example

To better understand the reward distribution, let's consider two scenarios where NFT holders receive profits from the trading contract.

#### Scenario 1: 10000 ETH Profit

In this scenario, the combined profit from trading contract and fees from opening on next networks is 10000 ETH. It will be distributed among the NFT holders based on the rarity of their NFTs. For example:

* Common NFT holders receive 20% of the profit (2000 ETH)
* Uncommon NFT holders receive 25% of the profit (2500 ETH)
* Rare NFT holders receive 25% of the profit (2500 ETH)
* Legendary NFT holders receive 30% of the profit (3000ETH)

The distribution of the 10,000 ETH in profits will be allocated among NFT holders based on the rarity of their NFT tokens. Here's the breakdown for each category per holder:\


1. **Common (4,000 tokens):** Common NFT holders will receive 20% of the profits, which amounts to 2,000 ETH. This sum will be distributed among the 4,000 Common token holders. Each Common holder will receive 2,000 ETH / 4,000 = <mark style="color:orange;">**0.5 ETH**</mark>.
2. **Uncommon (3,000 tokens):** Uncommon NFT holders will receive 25% of the profits, which amounts to 2,500 ETH. This sum will be distributed among the 3,000 Uncommon token holders. Each Uncommon holder will receive 2,500 ETH / 3,000 = <mark style="color:orange;">**0.8333 ETH**</mark>.
3. **Rare (2,000 tokens):** Rare NFT holders will receive 25% of the profits, which amounts to 2,500 ETH. This sum will be distributed among the 2,000 Rare token holders. Each Rare holder will receive 2,500 ETH / 2,000 = <mark style="color:orange;">**1.25 ETH**</mark>.
4. **Legendary (1,000 tokens):** Legendary NFT holders will receive 30% of the profits, which amounts to 3,000 ETH. This sum will be distributed among the 1,000 Legendary token holders. Each Legendary holder will receive 3,000 ETH / 1,000 = <mark style="color:orange;">**3 ETH**</mark>.
