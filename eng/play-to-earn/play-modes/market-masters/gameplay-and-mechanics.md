# Gameplay and Mechanics

### Entering the Mode

1. To participate in Market Masters, users must have $PLAYW tokens in their wallet.
2. Users can enter the mode by selecting it from the Play Wallet platform's interface.

### Making Predictions

1. Users choose from a list of available crypto projects with upcoming price prediction events.
2. Participants select their preferred time frame for the prediction: one week, two weeks, or one month.
3. Users place their prediction by inputting the future token price they anticipate.
4. Participants stake their $PLAYW tokens to confirm their prediction. The staked amount represents their confidence in the accuracy of their prediction.

### Reward Distribution Mechanism

1. After the prediction event is over, the smart contract evaluates the accuracy of all predictions.
2. The rewards are calculated using a parimutuel system, which distributes the total amount of tokens placed on the losing side among the winners. The distribution takes into account both the stake amount and the accuracy of the predictions.
3. The smart contract distributes the rewards automatically to the winning participants' wallets.

### Grading System, Badges, and Achievements

1. A grading system is in place to rank participants based on their overall win rate.
2. As users progress in the MarketMasters mode, they can earn badges and achievements that serve as status symbols within the community.
3. Badges and achievements can be viewed on the user's profile and the public leaderboard, providing a transparent track record of their success in predicting market trends.

By engaging with the MarketMasters mode, users can test their market analysis skills, earn rewards, and contribute to the development of a cutting-edge AI trading model for the entire Play Wallet community.
