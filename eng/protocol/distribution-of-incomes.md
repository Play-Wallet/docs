{% hint style="info" %}
For instance, let's say NFT sales have collected a total of 1000 ETH. From this amount, 80% (800 ETH) will be allocated to the Trading contract, 5% (50 ETH) will be used for marketing purposes, 10% (100 ETH) will go to the developers, and the remaining 5% (50 ETH) will be dedicated to $PLAYW staking.

### Trading contract profit

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the trading contract generates a profit of 136,000 ETH, 90% (122,400 ETH) will be distributed among NFT holders. The remaining 10% (13,600 ETH) will be allocated to the developers to support ongoing project development and maintenance.

### Play modes looses

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, let's assume that users lost 1000 ETH in Play modes. The entire amount 50% (500 ETH) will be directed to the Trading contract. Other 50% (500 ETH) will be distributed to users who stake $PLAYW&#x20;

### Fees from opening on next networks

{% hint style="info" %}
For instance, the initial launch of Play Wallet takes place on the Arbitrum network, followed by the second launch on the zkSync network, and the third launch on the Optimism network. NFT holders from the first launch will receive 10% of all profits generated during the second launch. Additionally, 10% of all profits from the third launch will be shared among NFT holders from both the first and second launches. This approach ensures that early participants in the project continue to benefit from its growth across various networks.\
